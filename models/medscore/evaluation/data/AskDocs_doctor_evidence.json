I can't know without examining you thoroughly and without an ankle brachial index (BP comparison between ankle and bicep.) You would also need an echocardiogram to confirm it. &#x200B; Let me answer the other question about the life expectancy. There is something you need to understand about life expectancy: It is a statistical figure. YOU are not a statistic. You are a real person with a real body that may or may not be similar to others. Not only that, but also the statistic you are pulling is for those who NEVER get treated. I don't like to tell patients their chances of survival or death based on averages. I prefer to tailor the discussion to the patient. From what you've said so far, it seems you have been mostly asymptomatic. The cause of morbidity and death for patients with this disease is development of hypertension, kidney disease, coronary artery disease, stroke, aortic dissection, and heart failure. From what you've said so far, I can say you most likely have not developed any of those complications, however some lab tests and imaging need to be done to check for sure. Your condition can still be salvaged and your life expectancy prolonged. Yes I believe you do have \"optimistic\" chances. IF it is coarctation of the aorta, you will need more lab tests and imaging and you will be managed accordingly. I assure you though, you will not drop dead suddenly just because you have coarctation of the aorta, it usually leads to complications which you will definitely notice. Try not to think too much about it, once you have confirmation of diagnosis, then work up can start and management can proceed.",

Given you were never treated before, you can be referred to advanced facilities where they can do a robotically assisted prostatectomy, laproscopic prostatectomy, or radiation only.

This makes it sound like your patient has actually received an external epidural catheter (ie, one that comes out through his skin and is hooked up to a pump outside his body). That would make more sense for something he can't leave the hospital with. If that is the case, the insurance company may want him switched to a \"general pain pump,\" by which they might mean a PCA pump, which delivers IV pain meds, although I'm not aware of many facilities that will accept a patient with either of these external pumps.

There are certainly circumstances where HIPAA does not apply, and each state could potentially have their own, more restrictive laws. For the purpose of answering this question, I will assume that HIPAA applies, and no other more restrictive statute is in effect. The pertinent part of HIPAA is the Privacy Rule, which governs what information is protected, and when disclosures can be made. The pertainent exception in this case is the treatment exception, which allows disclosures of protected health information for the purposes of treatment. This section specifically allows physicians who are treating the same patient to talk to each other. In other words, for your psychiatrist to talk to your primary care physician about an adverse medication effect is a permitted disclosure under HIPAA. They can discuss you without your explicit permission. But, your psychiatrist asked your permission. This suggests that they do not wish to do something that you would object to. Just because they CAN do it doesn't mean that they will. In any case, it is extremely important for your primary care physician to have this information.

My first question to you would be over how many many months has this weight loss from size 8 to size 0 occurred, and how many pounds have you lost? Most doctors do not think in sizing charts. I would want to know pounds and kilograms and over how many months. Close estimates are fine. Weight loss can have lots of causes, but its probably the most important of your complaints. I would suggest making a list of your complaints, but for an initial visit, understand that everything might not be addressed. Most primary doctors might only have a 30 slot in their schedule for a new patient sick visit. When scheduling your appointment, and they ask what its for, I would probably say unintentional weight loss, fatigue, vaginal growth. These are the ones most docs would be interested in first if you came in with this list.

Perhaps your gynecologist would be willing to follow the US guideline, and they can just document that you agreed to this and would understand the potential risk of fewer Paps. That said, the reason I would continue doing them is because while HPV is the primary cause of cervical cancer, it is not the only cause. Being on Humira, youre immune suppressed so youre at an increased risk for cancer. Its better to find potential precancerous cells early before they can spread.

It was also found in my right knee, and I am getting surgery for it soon. After speaking with my orthopedic surgeon, my AVN was deemed to be idiopathic, which means it had no known cause. Other things that may cause avascular necrosis include steroid use, excessive alcohol intake/abuse, chemotherapy, sickle cell disease, and certain hematological conditions. I highly recommend that you see an orthopedic surgeon who works with hips. Depending on how your CT scan looks, your doctor may order and MRI to get a better look of your hips. I see that you claimed not to have sickle cell disease or have used steroids excessively. When you speak to an orthopedic surgeon, they may ask you about your alcohol use. It is very important to be honest since excessive alcohol consumption is linked to AVN. It is also worrisome that you are having pain in your knees, and it should be examined by your doctor. Please be honest about everything with your doctor. They are not there to judge you. Rather, they are there to help you and recommend treatments. As a hematologist/oncologist, I would recommend talking to your doctor about a hematology workup to exclude certain diseases that may cause avascular necrosis. With osteonecrosis, we want to prevent the femoral head from collapsing. Once it has reached the collapse stage, treatment typically includes total hip replacements. Since your CT scan has showed that you are still in the pre collapse stage, your surgeon may recommend a surgery called a core decompression with or without bone grafting. I received this surgery in one of my hips, but your case may be totally different than mine. This is much less invasive than a total hip replacement, and it will help you with the pain. It may help delay the need for a total hip replacement, as you are a little too young for that at 29 years old. I am sorry to hear that you are going through this, and I understand what it feels like from a patient's perspective since I suffer from avascular necrosis. Speaking from personal experience, AVN is quite painful and you should have this investigated as soon as possible. Ask your PCP/GP for a referral to see an orthopedic surgeon ASAP. You really want to come up with a treatment plan before the articular surface begin to collapse. In the pre collapse stage, time is of the essence. I hope this helps!",

Half the time I get a negative strep test, but the doctor treats it like strep and prescribes antibiotics. Typically, I feel better pretty much the next day, so I just have assumed that it was strep. Antibiotics do not alter the course of strep throat in this way. Studies suggest that symptoms of strep throat last 5-7 days, and that antibiotics reduce this by 12-24 hours. If you had a negative throat culture, then it is extraordinarily likely that you didn't have strep throat. The overuse of antibiotics is a huge problem for society in general, and for individuals. Some patients, apparently like yourself, are given unnecessary antibiotics over and over again, and are at high risk for the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms, as well as other issues that can develop, such as changes in the gut microbiome that can lead to diarrhea, and other serious infections like pseudomembranous colitis. A doctor should only prescribe antibiotics for a sore throat after a positive strep test.

If by normal you mean \"is this a policy that exists at some emergency departments, and is somewhat reasonable\", then the answer is yes. Physicians are struggling to put the Genii back in the bottle. For various reasons (primarily marketing decisions by the pharmaceutical industry) the use of prescribed opioids became widespread in the US. This has contributed to a widespread problem with opioid use disorder. We are all trying to treat our patients as well as we can, and to minimize the use of opioids, as the adverse effects, including addiction, can be severe. Some emergency departments (usually in areas with a high prevalence of opioid use disorder) have established policies like this. Their belief is (in my opinion) that the policy is a tool that physicians can use to help explain why patients aren't getting opioids for common problems like a sprained ankle or low back pain, where the risk far outweighs the benefit.

VZV (chicken pox and shingles), EBV (that causes mono) and CMV (a common problem in kidney transplant recipients) are also herpes viruses. Those viruses get into your system, your body fights it off, and after that they stay dorment somehwere in your body. VZV goes to your nerves, EBV goes to your lymph nodes and herpes stays around your mucus membranes, HSV-1 prefers the mouth. During certain conditions, and we are not completely sure how, the virus can reactivate and then you get a cold sore if it's HSV-1. But some people never get cold sores. People with an immune disorder (like patients with cancer, transplantation or HIV) are at risk for getting severe re-infections from all these herpesvirusses if they carry them. So there is no telling if there is HSV-1 in your body. You can also get it from someone who never has HSV outbreaks but has encountered the virus in the past.

You've obviously been seeing a musculoskeletal specialist since you got ESWT; make sure they're evaluating your overall movement patterns and joint health including your back, hip joints, and feet. Sometimes nerve pain radiating from the back is a tricky mimic. And regardless, everything is connected, so sometimes something as simple as a foot orthotic can change your mechanics and relieve pain higher up. You can also ask your doctor about the role of regenerative treatments like PRP, or seek a second opinion if you haven't already. Finally, sometimes we try everything possible and people continue to have chronic pain.

Sometimes it is impossible to tell a renal cell carcinoma from other types of renal tumors (benign or malignant) by imaging, and you have to see what pathology says. You will probably be referred to a urologist to discuss surgery, and options will depend on the size and location (possibilities are removing part of the kidney or sometimes the whole kidney). The liver and ovary things may be nothing but probably warrant a follow-up exam to make sure there is no additional tumor.",

Remember that like the COVID vaccine, the point is to reduce the number of people who get so sick that they need hospitalization. Even if you needed to go to the ER, it could be that if you hadn't been vaccinated, you would have needed to go to the ICU, or you would've been sick for 2 weeks, not just 5 days. Another way that the flu vaccine isn't perfect is that it's always based on our best estimate of which strains of influenza will be prevalent that season. We can't 100% predict, so sometimes there isn't a perfect match there. It's disappointing to get an illness for which you've been vaccinated, but we know that statistically the vaccine is reducing the number of hospitalizations and deaths, no matter your individual experience.

That said, if your last pap was completely normal then it is unlikely that a carcinoma will have developed. Unlikely, but not impossible. The length of time between cervical screening tests is chosen because in the vast majority of cases simple cellular atypia will not turn malignant over this time. As good as the screens are they depend on human skills to sample the correct area of the cervix. Sometimes the abnormal area gets missed. The tests also don't give a warning in time if someone develops a particularly aggressive, fast growing cancer that could spring up between smears. This is why it's vitally important to stay vigilant for the signs and symptoms of cervical cancer, no matter what the smear says.",

You see the cycle. Couple this with anxiety, and you find yourself in your current predicament. My advice: 1.

So if he was started on modified release, it may be worth trying IR.

Carbon monoxide competes with Oxygen for delivering nutrients to your tissues and has much more affinity than Oxygen for Hemoglobin.

They will misinterpret medical interventions as inappropriate sexual contact. These medical interventions are things like foley catheters, cleaning up urine/stool, venous and arterial catheters in the femoral vessels, applying skin creams to vulnerable areas, etc. I would suspect the most likely explanation for your situation was that they were cleaning you up after pooping in your sleep or applying skin cream to an irritated area.",

I've also never heard of anyone needing general anesthesia for it, which makes me think it's overtreating as a cash grab (unless they meant local anesthesia). If you tried shock wave and found the treatment useful but the session intolerable, I guess you could consider general anesthesia - and just because I haven't heard of it doesn't mean it's not a common practice somewhere - but it doesn't seem worth the risk at all. Stretch your calves religiously and massage your feet with your hands or with a golf ball. Take it easy on any activities that tend to set your symptoms off (eg running) until they're under control.
