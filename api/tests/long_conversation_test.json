    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "Hi, I'm not sure where to start."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "That's okay. Take your time. What brought you here today?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. Work has been stressful."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "I hear that you're feeling overwhelmed by work stress. Can you tell me more about what's been happening?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "My boss keeps piling on more projects, and I can't seem to keep up."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "It sounds like the workload has been increasing significantly. How has that been affecting you?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "I'm exhausted all the time. I barely sleep anymore."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "Sleep difficulties can be really challenging. How many hours are you getting per night?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "Maybe 4 or 5 hours, if I'm lucky."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "That's quite limited. What's going through your mind when you're trying to fall asleep?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "I keep thinking about all the things I didn't finish during the day."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "Those racing thoughts can make it hard to relax. Have you noticed any patterns in your sleep struggles?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "It's worse on Sunday nights when I think about the week ahead."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "Sunday anxiety about the upcoming week is very common. How do you usually cope with these feelings?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "I don't really cope. I just push through and hope it gets better."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "It takes strength to push through, but it sounds exhausting. What would 'better' look like for you?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "I guess just feeling less anxious about everything."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "Reducing anxiety is a meaningful goal. What areas of your life does the anxiety affect most?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "Mostly work, but it's starting to affect my relationships too."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "Can you share an example of how it's impacting your relationships?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "My partner says I'm always distracted and irritable."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "It sounds like your partner has noticed changes in you. How do you feel when they bring this up?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "Guilty, I guess. I know I haven't been present."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "Guilt can be a heavy feeling. What do you think is making it hard for you to be present?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "My mind is always at work, even when I'm home."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "That mental boundary between work and home seems blurred. When did you first notice this happening?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "Probably around 6 months ago when I got promoted."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "A promotion can bring both opportunities and new pressures. How did you feel about the promotion initially?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "I was excited at first, but now I'm wondering if I made a mistake."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "It's understandable to have mixed feelings. What aspects make you question the decision?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "The responsibility is just so much more than I expected."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "Feeling unprepared for new responsibilities can be daunting. Have you been able to talk to anyone at work about this?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "No, I don't want them to think I can't handle it."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "There's a concern about being perceived as incapable. What do you imagine would happen if you asked for support?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "They might regret promoting me or think I'm weak."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "Those fears sound very real to you. Have you seen others ask for help at your workplace?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "Actually, yes. My colleague asked for training on a new system last month."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "And how was that received by the team?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "They were supportive. She got the training she needed."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "So there's evidence that asking for help can lead to positive outcomes. What makes your situation feel different?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "I guess I hold myself to a different standard."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "Many people are harder on themselves than others. Where do you think that standard comes from?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "My parents were always very demanding. Nothing was ever good enough."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "Growing up with high parental expectations can shape how we see ourselves. How does that continue to affect you now?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "I still hear my dad's voice saying I need to work harder."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "That internalized voice can be powerful. What would you say to a friend in your position?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "I'd probably tell them they're doing their best and that's enough."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "That's a compassionate response. What makes it hard to extend that same compassion to yourself?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "I don't know. It just feels different when it's me."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "Self-compassion can be challenging to practice. Would you be open to exploring some strategies together?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "Yes, I think I need to try something different."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "That openness to change is an important first step. What small change do you think might be most helpful right now?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "Maybe setting some boundaries with work hours?"},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "Setting boundaries is a great place to start. What would realistic boundaries look like for you?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "Maybe not checking emails after 8 PM?"},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "That sounds like a specific, achievable goal. What might get in the way of maintaining that boundary?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "The fear that I'll miss something urgent."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "That's a valid concern. How often have truly urgent issues come up after 8 PM in the past few months?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "Honestly? Maybe once or twice."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "So urgent situations are relatively rare. What could you do to prepare for those rare occasions while still protecting your evening time?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "I could let my team know I'm available by phone for emergencies only."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "That sounds like a balanced approach that protects both your time and your responsibilities. How do you feel about trying this?"},
    {"speaker": "Client", "text": "Nervous, but I think it's worth trying."},
    {"speaker": "Therapist", "text": "It's natural to feel nervous about changes. What support do you need to make this work?"}
