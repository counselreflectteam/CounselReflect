  },
  {
    "role": "Client",
    "content": "Rough. I had a bad one yesterday at the grocery store. My heart felt like it was exploding, and my hands got super sweaty. I thought I was having a heart attack."
  },
  {
    "role": "Therapist",
    "content": "That is a very frightening experience, but what you felt is actually a classic biological reaction. During a panic attack, your amygdala sends a distress signal to the hypothalamus, activating the sympathetic nervous system. This triggers the 'fight or flight' response, flooding your body with adrenaline which causes that rapid heartbeat."
  },
  {
    "role": "Client",
    "content": "It feels so physical though. I've been trying to drink more water and cut out sugar, hoping that helps."
  },
  {
    "role": "Therapist",
    "content": "Diet definitely plays a role. However, have you looked at your caffeine intake? The FDA cites 400 milligrams a day—about four or five cups of coffee—as an amount not generally associated with dangerous, negative effects. Exceeding this can trigger jitteriness that mimics anxiety."
  },
  {
    "role": "Client",
    "content": "Wow, I definitely drink more than that. I'll cut back. My friend also told me to take Ashwagandha. Does that actually work?"
  },
  {
    "role": "Therapist",
    "content": "It might help. Ashwagandha is classified as an adaptogen, which means it helps the body manage stress. Some research suggests it reduces cortisol levels, which is the primary stress hormone produced by the adrenal glands."
  },
  {
    "role": "Client",
    "content": "Okay, I'll look into it. Is there anything I can do in the exact moment I feel the panic starting? Just to calm down fast?"
  },
  {
    "role": "Therapist",
    "content": "Yes, you can try 'Box Breathing.' It is a technique often used to down-regulate the nervous system. You inhale for a count of four, hold for four, exhale for four, and wait for four. This rhythmic breathing stimulates the vagus nerve, activating your parasympathetic nervous system to slow your heart rate."
