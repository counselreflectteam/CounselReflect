# Results directories - user generated outputs

# HTML reports

# Excel and JSON result files - but keep reference samples
# IMPORTANT: Negation rules must come in specific order
# 1. First, ignore the pattern globally
*.xlsx
*_results.json

# 2. Then, explicitly un-ignore the directories containing exceptions
!samples/
!samples/results/

# 3. Finally, re-ignore everything in those directories EXCEPT our samples
